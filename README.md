A Multiwii Serial Protocol (MSP) CLI
===========================================

async_msp_cli is a command line program for configuring rebooting, getting status and downloading blackbox from Cleanflight, Betaflight and iNav.
This is an incomplete implementation of the MSP2 commands, with some Cleanflight, Betaflight and iNav extensions.

1. Mimic iNav, betaflight cli
2. Send MSP commands asynchronously
3. Be as fast and efficient as possible

The dump has the same syntax as configurator dump command output
```
mmix 0  1.000 -1.000  1.000 -1.000
mmix 1  1.000 -1.000 -1.000  1.000
...

feature -TX_PROF_SEL
feature THR_VBAT_COMP
...

aux 0 51 6 1100 1200
aux 1 52 6 1400 1500
...

set gyro_hardware_lpf = 256HZ
set gyro_lpf_hz = 90
...

```

### Installation
Compiling from this repository also works similarly:

You can compile from source by
[installing Cargo](https://crates.io/install)
([Rust's](https://www.rust-lang.org/) package manager)
and installing `async_msp_cli` using Cargo:

```bash
cargo install --locked async_msp_cli
```

```bash
git clone git://github.com/BurntSushi/async_msp_cli
cd async_msp_cli
cargo build --release
```

Compilation will probably take a few minutes depending on your machine. The
binary will end up in `./target/release/async_msp_cli`.
